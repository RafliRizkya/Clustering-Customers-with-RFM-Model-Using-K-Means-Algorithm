# Clustering-Customers-with-RFM-Model-Using-K-Means-Algorithm

This project analyzes customer behavior based on an e-commerce transaction dataset and segments customers using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model with K-Means clustering.

## Dataset
The analysis is based on the Kaggle dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data

The dataset contains 541,909 transaction records from an online retail store across several countries. This project aims to understand customer purchasing behavior and categorize customers into meaningful segments.

## Tools & Technologies
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Power BI
- Programming Language: Python (sklearn, pandas, numpy)
- Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, Power BI Dashboard

## Dashboards

### General Transaction Overview Dashboard

![general dashboard](e%-%commerce%dashboard%overview.png)

This dashboard provides a high-level overview of the business's transactional performance.
It allows decision-makers to quickly assess how the company is performing across time and regions, identify purchasing trends, and spot potential areas of growth or concern.

### RFM-Based Customer Segmentation Dashboard

This dashboard visualizes the results of customer segmentation using RFM and K-Means clustering.
It helps businesses understand different types of customers, tailor marketing strategies for each segment, and prioritize high-value groups for retention or reactivation campaigns.

## Summary
Through this project:
- I explored and cleaned large-scale transactional data.
- Created a new RFM segmentation table based on the Kaggle dataset to evaluate customer value.
- Applied the RFM model to assess Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics for each customer.
- Implemented K-Means clustering to discover distinct customer groups.
- Visualized insights in Power BI to support data-driven decision-making.
